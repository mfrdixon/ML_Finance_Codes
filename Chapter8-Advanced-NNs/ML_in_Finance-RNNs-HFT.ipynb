    "### Overview\n",
    "- This notebook provides an example of how Keras can be used to train and test TensorFlow RNNs for time series prediction. The example dataset is for predicting from noisy, non-stationary data.\n",
    "- Statistical methods used for autoregressive models shall be used to identify the sequence length needed in the RNN and to diagnose the model error.\n",
    "- Plain RNNs are not suited to non-stationary time series modeling. We can use a GRU or LSTM to model non-stationary data, since these models exhibit dynamic auto-correlation structure.\n",
    "- Unlike classical time series methods, e.g. ARIMA, there are no parametric assumptions on the distribution of the errors, and non-linear relationships between response and predictors can be captured. "

    "#### Statistician's note\n",
    "- We choose to build a model which provides strong predictive power, at the expense of reduced explanatory power. \n",
    "- Our choice to use a recurrent neural network is predicated on each observation in the time series being dependent on previous observations. The ordering of the observations therefore matters and $X$ is not iid.\n",
    "- Once the input data is appropriately scaled, model building starts with 'feature selection' - identifying the relevant features to include in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this notebook, we assume that we've already identifed the relevant set of features (i.e. there is only one time series provided).\n",
    "- Our primary concern is assessing the extent to which the model is over-fitting, by comparing the in- and out-of-sample MSEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation notes\n",
    "- It is important to ensure that `shuffle=False` in the fit function, otherwise the ordering of sequences is not preserved. This is especially important for methods which have memory beyond the current sequence (i.e. all methods except RNNs).\n",
    "- Time series cross-validation must be used for hyper-parameter tuning because the ordering of the data matters. In particular, the model must never use training data more recent than the forecasting observation date."

    "This may lead to a high order model, with more lags than strictly necessary. We could view this value, informally, as an upper bound on the number of lags needed. We can also simply identify the order of the model based on the plot of the PACF. In this case, a minimum of 2 lags appears satisfactory, although more may be needed. Unlike autoregressive models, the advantage of using fewer parameters is purely computational as adding more lags does not increase the number of parameters, only the size of the tensorial representation of the sequence data in TensorFlow.

Hence, we will simply standardize the training set using the mean and standard deviation of the training set and not the whole time series.

    "A fitted time series model must be examined for underfitting with a white noise test. We analyze the model residuals (i.e. the error $u_t$) to determine whether it is white noise or whether it is auto-correlated. The latter case provides statistical evidence that more lags are needed in the RNN. Box and Pierce propose the Portmanteau statistic:\n",

There are several heuristics in the statistics literature to determine the maximum lag such as the Schwert statistic. \n",

    "This statistic also follows an asymptotically chi-squared distribution with $m$ degrees of freedom. The decision rule is to reject $H_0$ if $Q(m)>\\chi_{\\alpha}^2$ where $\\chi_{\\alpha}^2$ denotes the $100(1-\\alpha)^{th}$ percentile of a chi-squared distribution with m degrees of freedom and is the significance level for rejecting $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test can be time consuming and we select a subset of the residuals. Here we simply set the maximum lag to 20. In the results below, we find that the p-values are all smaller than 0.01, indicating that we can reject the null at the 99% confidence level for any lag. This is strong evidence that the model is under-fitting and more lags are needed in our model. Unlike an auto-regressive model, increasing the number of lags in the RNN does not increase the number of weights. Thus there is no danger of over-fitting by increasing the lag, although there will be an increase in the training time."
