    "We can build on the previous two examples by considering the problem of high frequency market making. Unlike the previous example, we shall learn a time independent optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that a market maker seeks to capture the bid-ask spread by placing one lot best bid and ask limit orders. They are required to strictly keep their inventory between -1 and 1. The problem is when to optimally quote either a bid or ask, or simply wait, each time there is a limit order book update. For example, sometimes it may be more advantageous to quote a bid to close out a short position if it will almost surely give an instantaneous net reward, other times it may be better to wait and capture a larger spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this toy example, the agent uses the liquidity imbalance in the top of the order book as a proxy for price movement and, hence, fill probabilities. The example does not use market orders, knowledge of queue positions, cancellations and limit order placement at different levels of the ladder. These are left to later material and exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each non-uniform time update, $t$, the market feed provides best prices and depths $\\{p^a_t, q^a_t, p^b_t, q^b_t\\}$. The state space is the product of the inventory, $X_t\\in\\{-1,0,1\\}$, and gridded liquidity ratio $\\hat{R}_t= \\lfloor{\\frac{q^a_t}{q^a_t+q^b_t}N\\rfloor}\\in [0,1]$, where $N$ is the number of grid points and $q^a_t$ and $q^b_t$ are the depths of the best ask and bid. $\\hat{R}_t \\rightarrow 0$ is the regime where the mid-price will go up and an ask is filled. Vice versa for $\\hat{R}_t \\rightarrow 1$. The dimension of the state space is chosen to be $ 3 \\cdot 10 = 30$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bid is filled with probability $\\epsilon_t:=\\hat{R}_t$ and an ask is filled with probability $1-\\epsilon_t$. The rewards are chosen to be the expected total P\\&L. If a bid is filled to close out a short holding, then the expected reward $r_t=-\\epsilon_t (\\Delta p_t+c)$, where $\\Delta p_t$ is the difference between the exit and entry price and $c$ is the transaction cost. For example, if the agent entered a short position at time $s<t$ with a filled ask at $p^a_s=100$ and closed out the position with a filled bid at $p^b_t=99$, then $\\Delta p_t=1$. The agent is penalized for quoting an ask or bid when the position is already short or long respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now apply SARSA or Q-learning to learn optimal market making in such a simplified setting. For exploration needed for on-line learning, one can use a\n",
    "$\\varepsilon $-greedy policy."
